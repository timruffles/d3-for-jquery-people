Her parents (my maternal GGP) were immigrants from China, and they moved to Florida after some years on the West Coast because they had heard things were better here. I remember her telling me a lot of stories about her childhood -- and how it was so radically different from that with \"all of (our) new machines and games\" -- but one of the things that seemed most significant in my mind was that she was only permitted to study through the second grade because her parents wanted her to work on the farm.\n\nA daughter of Chinese immigrants managed to get through the second grade, but supported and raised seven children, all of whom became doctors, engineers, or computer scientists. She managed to push them through college in spite of living in a small townhouse in the middle of Baltimore. If that's not the most goddamn inspiring thing I've ever heard of, I don't know what is.\n\nShe was as sharp a mind as anyone I knew - perhaps not academically, but she had an excellent intuition and liked to speak her mind on life matters; there were several incidences in my life when her advice would become extremely relevant in my life just days or weeks after she had mentioned it. She managed to pick up a lot of English and multiple dialects of Chinese both in her childhood in Florida and after she had married and moved to Baltimore, and had all sorts of Chinese remedies that she had been taught about in her childhood.\n\nSkipping ahead quite a lot -- in the late eighties and early nineties (before I was born + the first few years of my life) she formally established her place as the aforementioned \"strongest person I know.\" She was diagnosed with cancer, and fought for years before finally overcoming it; she never feared for her life, and the only thing she ever spoke of it was the fact that the doctor that treated her \"made the front page of the paper!\" She contended with terrible rheumatoid arthritis at the same time, as well as a rapidly decreasing body weight that would compound her problems later in life.\n\nI was midway through an internship at Johns Hopkins when I had heard that she had suffered from heart failure, and I took off from work and visited her at the hospital. She eventually came to live with my family (my mother, father, three brothers and I) because my mother -- a physician -- wanted to take care of some emerging problems with the doctor that was treating her in the city.  It was eventually suggested that her arthritis had become too severe for her to walk properly -- although my grandmother would have nothing of it -- and eventually she had to choose between a bunianectomy (moving tissues around the joint of the big toe) and amputation of her big toe. She opted for the latter, as a bunionectomy would take about a month of therapy -- if not more, considering her age -- before she could walk properly. At this time, a naive youngest-brother-of-mine asked how she was feeling, and particularly if she was sad. She remarked: \"Renomitsu's youngest brother, I do feel sad sometimes, maybe even a lot. But what has kept me going for thirty years now are my children and grand-children. I feel pain everywhere all of the time now, but none of it matters. I had a great life and nothing can take that away from me, not cancer, not heart attacks, nothing.\"\n\nFast-forward another several months and she's moved back to her house, had a second heart attack, and is forced to go to a hospice with each of her children sitting in on her in twenty-four hour shifts. She's miserable - not because she is in pain, but because she doesn't want to be taken care of \"like a child.\" I'm feeling miserable at the end of Fall semester because I feel that the inevitable is coming.\n\nI ask my aunt and immediate family to step out so I can speak with her in what would turn out to be the last time I would ever speak with her. Immediately, she says, \"Renomitsu, you've lost something.\"\n\nI pause, and I realize that she, in spite of not ever being told, knew that something had changed in me. My grades in my first semester of college (one year prior) were okay, but the second semester, I was facing several personal problems and my grades declined - but again, she didn't know any of that.\n\nShe followed up, \"You've lost something, but I know you can get it back. Don't do it in a hurry, though - you're young. Don't bite off more than you can chew. You're a smart boy Renomitsu, and when you were a child there wasn't anything that you wouldn't do for your family. I know you want to be a doctor like your father, and I know that you can get us on the front page of the paper someday. But you've lost something, and now you have to figure out how to get it back -- I have faith in you.\n\nI was bawling my eyes out for the next couple of hours, and over the next several weeks (going into winter break) I couldn't help but tear up -- she was absolutely right. I visited her several times over that period, but she had begun to decline even further and couldn't speak - and was not even conscious, most of the time, to know that I was there.\n\nShe eventually passed away in her sleep, having never complained about anything except having to be taken care of.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 79, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of one of the most beautiful stories I&amp;#39;ve read on reddit, by &lt;a href=\"/u/Renomitsu\"&gt;/u/Renomitsu&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My grandmother passed away a month and a half ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was the strongest person I knew, and never asked for help -- but gave it at every single opportunity.
